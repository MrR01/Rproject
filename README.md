Amazon Food Review Project in R. Demostration the use of machine learning models, K-fold Cross Validation for linear regression, Support Vector Machine and k-Nearest Neighbour. Plot and comparing the three models. 
Stochastic Gradient Boosting also used. You will see Normality Test failed. 

Cross validation of neural network model, Naive Bayes, Linear Discriminant Analysis and Ordinal logistic regression were attempted but could be used because they are classification models as dataset were continous variables.
